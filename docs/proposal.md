Team name: Calculator App

Team members: Alexander Klein, Donovan Heynen, Jacob Lockwood, Simon Hillebrands, Kameron Freeman

# Introduction

The goal of our project is to create a mathematical application that is geared towards college students. This will have many features including graphing, step by step solutions, and much more. We want our project to be ready for you as soon as we can, so when we first release the app, it may seem simple, but we will be adding new features every 2-3 weeks.

Upon release, the app will be a simple standard calculator with the ability to do a variety of functions ranging from algebraic to statistics. In our first update, we hope to add a step-by-step functionality that allows the user to input an equation and outputs the solution with an explaination for each step of the way. After this, we plan on creating a graphing calculator aspect that takes the user inputted equations and plots them on a grid, that will also be able to solve systems of linear equations. The release, as well as the new feature updates, will be available solely for Android initially, with hopes of possibly hitting the Apple store on day. 

# Anticipated Technologies

Android Studio, GitHub, Git Bash, Android Devices
